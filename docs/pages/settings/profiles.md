### Connection profiles

We call these connection specific settings a 'connection profile'. The settings stored into a profile are:

- Those settings maintained by clicking Settings in the status bar ![Connection Profile Settings](assets/Connect_Profile_Setting_01.png)

- The Home / working directory
- The Current library
- The Library list
- The IFS shortcuts
- The Object browser list
- The Database browser list

Save the settings into a profile using the S**ave current settings button** on the USER LIBRARY LIST view.

Give it a unique name, or use an existing name to overwrite an existing profile.

To load a profile, which would update the settings, use the **Set active profile** button on the Library List view.

You might use this if you use a single box to manage many different applications that have different source files and/or library lists.
